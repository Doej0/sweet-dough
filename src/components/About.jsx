        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            My name is Kenya Brown. I like to watch cooking shows, experiment
            with new tastes, recipes and “BAKE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX” 
            </p>
            <p>
            I was born
            and raised in the Coastal city of Savannah Georgia where food,
            family and fun are just as essential as the air you breath! Cooking
            is a natural passion of my family heritage. <br/>My late father molded my
            love for desserts. I grew up to the warmth of a stovetop and oven
            that constantly served up mouthwatering, enticing smells of pies,
            cakes, cinnamon rolls, puddings, cookies, crisps and cobblers that
            welcomed you in from the sidewalk of our home. On holidays,
            birthdays and Sunday’s, I woke up to the smell of sweet dough rising
            and I am excited to share my passion with you!
          </p>
          <p> Come on in and try
            some of the delicious desserts I have grown to love!</p>
